Certainly! Let's build your firewall server in Python step-by-step. Given the complexity of this project, I'll guide you through setting up the project structure, implementing initial functionalities, and testing them. You will learn how to handle packet filtering, IP management, and logging.

### Step 1: Setting Up the Project Environment

First, ensure Python 3.6 or later is installed. Use a virtual environment for your project to manage dependencies.

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   Open a terminal and run:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv firewall_env
   source firewall_env/bin/activate  # On Unix/Linux
   firewall_env\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
   You'll need `scapy` for packet manipulation and `netfilterqueue` to interact with iptables queue.

   ```bash
   pip install scapy netfilterqueue
   ```

### Step 2: Project Structure Setup

Create the directory structure as discussed previously. You can use terminal commands or your file explorer to create these directories and files.

### Step 3: Implementing Packet Filtering

1. **Create the `packet_filter.py`**:
   Navigate to the `src` directory, create `packet_filter.py`, and add the following code:

   ```python
   from scapy.all import IP, TCP

   def filter_packet(packet):
       # Block packets from a specific IP
       if packet[IP].src == '192.168.1.100':
           print("Blocking packet from IP: 192.168.1.100")
           return False
       # Allow HTTP traffic
       if packet[TCP].dport == 80:
           print("Allowing HTTP traffic")
           return True
       return True
   ```

2. **Create the `main.py`**:
   This file will set up the packet sniffing and utilize the `packet_filter`.

   ```python
   from scapy.all import sniff
   from packet_filter import filter_packet

   def start_firewall():
       print("Firewall is running...")
       sniff(filter="ip", prn=filter_packet, store=0)

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       start_firewall()
   ```

### Step 4: IP Blocking/Allowing using `iptables`

1. **Create the `ip_manager.py`**:
   This module will manage IP rules.

   ```python
   import subprocess

   def modify_iptables(action, ip):
       rule = f"sudo iptables -{action} INPUT -s {ip} -j DROP"
       subprocess.run(rule, shell=True)

   def block_ip(ip):
       modify_iptables('A', ip)  # Add rule

   def unblock_ip(ip):
       modify_iptables('D', ip)  # Delete rule
   ```

### Step 5: Implement Logging

1. **Create the `logger.py`**:
   This module will handle logging functionalities.

   ```python
   import logging

   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

   def log_packet(packet_info):
       logging.info(f"Packet info: {packet_info}")
   ```

2. **Integrate Logging in `packet_filter.py`**:
   Add a call to the `log_packet` function from `logger.py` in `packet_filter.py`.

   ```python
   from logger import log_packet

   def filter_packet(packet):
       if packet[IP].src == '192.168.1.100':
           log_packet("Blocking packet from IP: 192.168.1.100")
           return False
       return True
   ```

### Step 6: Testing Your Firewall

1. **Writing Simple Tests**:
   Navigate to the `tests` directory and create `test_packet_filter.py`.

   ```python
   from scapy.all import IP, TCP, Ether
   from src.packet_filter import filter_packet

   def test_filter_packet():
       # Create a dummy packet
       packet = IP(src="192.168.1.100")/TCP(dport=80)
       # Test IP blocking
       assert filter_packet(packet) == False

       # Create another dummy packet
       packet = IP(src="192.168.1.101")/TCP(dport=80)
       # Test HTTP allowance
       assert filter_packet(packet) == True
   ```

2. **Run the Tests**:
   Use `pytest` or simply run your test script in Python to ensure the functionality works as expected.

### Step 7: Documenting Your Project

Write documentation in the `docs/` directory, explaining how each part of your firewall works and how to configure or extend it.

### Final Notes

- Always test your code in a safe environment.
- You may need superuser rights to modify iptables and run network-related

 operations.

This guide covers the initial setup and basic functionalities. As you progress, you can further develop and refine each component based on your project's requirements.
